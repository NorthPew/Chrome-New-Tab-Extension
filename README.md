- Aim to make it easy to customize.
- Keep this project open source.
- Keep this extension minimalistic in a way.

### This extension is a remix!
This extension is inspired by a popular extension called *night tab*. You may wonder why I created this extension when night tab already exists. The answer is that I wanted to customize my own new tab page and I used night tab as a reference to learn from. I don't use any code that the creator used when making night tab. Also, why are there so many chromium based browsers out there? They are all variations of the same core. They are so called *remixes*! Covers of songs are also remixes.  Even non original songs uses "remix" in their titles.



### Data collecting
You can relax and enjoy this extension without worrying about your privacy. It doesn't track, store or use any of your data. This extension is a browser-based application that does not require any server connection or data transmission. Your personal information is stored locally on your device and never shared with anyone.
The only permission it needs, is to access chrome's built in feature called storage so the extension can save your bookmarks, folders and quick menu items. Localstorage can't help keeping your important stuff safe.

Do you use Firefox or a non-chromium based browser? Then you can try to use this in preview mode but be sure to keep your localstorage data safe from cleaning your browser, or you might lose all your bookmarks, folders and quick menu items!

<details><summary><h3>chrome.storage</h3></summary>

This extension uses *chrome.storage* in order to save all stuff such as your folders, quick menu items and bookmarks. It falls in the permissions tab in the *manifest json*. Without this permission, all your stuff will be gone every time you clean your browser or when you close it. Here's how it's used: <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/">chrome storage</a>.

This extension will in the end be supported in other browsers such as Brave, Edge and Thorium ❤️
You can still use it on any chromium browser, even tho I have not tested it on those before.
Please tell me if something is messed up in your browser.

### Alternatives
**night tab** is a great alternative to this extension if you are looking for a different experience. It is compatible with both chromium and firefox browsers, so you can enjoy its features on any platform. However, you should be aware that night tab uses an older manifest version for chrome, which may not work well with newer versions of chrome. Also, the developer of night tab has not updated it for a long time, so it may have some bugs or issues. Night tab will always be the best tab interface.
